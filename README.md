# ROHSA-SNAPD
ROHSA-SNAPD "Spatially Non-parametric Approach to PSF Deconvolution using ROHSA" is an adaptable kinematic modelling tool. 

The code utilises kinematic regularisation to forward model the intrinsic emission-line flux and kinematics (velocity and line-width) of 3D data cubes. Kinematic regularisation removes the need to assume an underlying rotation model (eg. exponential disc, tilted-ring) to deconvolve kinematic data. 

ROHSA-SNAPD builds upon the core features of [ROHSA](https://github.com/antoinemarchal/ROHSA) developed by Antoine Marchal.
